However, these events can cause an individual to have difficulty breathing if the tongue blocks the throat. Sometimes, people can also get oral injuries.When a person falls unconscious, the muscles relax, including the tongue. If a person is lying on their back, the relaxed tongue can block the throat and partially or completely obstruct their breathing.\n" +
